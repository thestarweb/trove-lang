Now, go to the future.\n\nPut the Futurator on your action bar, throw it, and go through to the future. Find the Citadel, and get to the top. It is somewhere nearby.

We were the scourge of the seas, and we were everywhere at once... because there were two of us! But hard to find of course, because we were elusive pirates.\n\nI stopped working out and lost a lot of muscle mass while he... got meaner. I set up shop in the Hub. But he... he went into hiding. He created the Saminators, and caused the future that we all will suffer with. I need to think about what I would do if I were him. Which I am, basically.\n\nGet a few fish for me, would you? It helps me focus.

You may have noticed that the Saminator sailors have collected diary pages from ...a stowaway perhaps? This person seems to know how to catch plasma fish. Find the final page! A deserter was spotted escaping to the desert with some papers. Find him and bring back the final page of these stowaway notes!

$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_meteor_11_Name=Collect the Scout Saucer
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_meteor_11_Description=Meteor Chase 11/11: You did it! You reconstructed a flying saucer from... an alien visitor who crashed to our world.

$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_september2020_07_Name=Give the "Pirate" Chest to Saltwater Sam in the Hub
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_september2020_07_Description=Pirate Captains vs Neon Ninjas 7/7: I bet Saltwater Sam would feel a lot better if you took that Chest to him. That chest would let him know the Neon Ninjas are not trying to step on the pirate's toes and this is all Q'bthulhu's doing. Last I saw him, he was hanging out in his boat in the hub.

$Quest_GoldenThread_event_september2021_09_Description=Fae Vs Undead 2021 9/9: Well Trovian, I guess its not really fair for us to make you pick sides. How about this? The Undead have a crafting Cauldron and the Prince has a crafting Hookah. Why don't you go make a terraformer and terraform your very own Tombs? Whichever one you craft will be the winner, for you at least! Just saying, Undead for life (or death, you get it?!). Just go make one. Oh, and you'll need those Honor Tokens to craft them.

$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_02_Description=Shadow's Eve 2/11: Greetings Trovian. I am Lunavic, High Priest of the Order of the Moon. It is wondrous to meet you, even on such a shadowed occasion. Our order stands against the Shadow on all occasions, but especially when its strength is at its peak, during Shadow’s Eve.\n\nThis year a terrible curse has fallen upon the Medieval Highlands, Desert Frontier, and Cursed Vale. The curse turns normal monsters into shadow infused mindless beasts. Will you aid us in the defense of Trove during this dark time? Craft an Order of the Moon Purification Seal to cleanse yourself of darkness and join the fight against the Shadow.

Their numbers are without end!\n\nI can sense the blessings of the Moon Goddess upon you. This is good, because what I ask will require all the help you can get. This Curse must have a source; we must find it! \n\nPerhaps a clue lies within the nearby dungeons. Try clearing some and see what you can find.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2021_06_Name=Clear a Pumpkin Dungeon.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_06_Description=Shadow's Eve 6/11: Oh my, this is awful. These wolves are overrunning everything! And what’s that, Lunar Condensate?! We'll have to get that back to the quartermasters, but first we must investigate the Pumpkin Dungeons that have started appearing. Perhaps they are the source.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2021_07_Name=Return to the High Priest.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_07_Description=Shadow's Eve 7/11: This is worse than I feared. Were-Pumpkins?! This curse can even affect plants.

Return to the High Priest and report what you have found.\n\nPress [HK:Loot] to interact with an npc.

It begins with a single corrupted soul and spreads like a plague with each bite and scratch. Thanks to the Lunar Seals you are protected, but others.... \n\nThis Lunar Condensate comes from the depths of the Delves. I suspect you will find the source of this curse there. Using this Lunar Condensate you can craft a gateway to where it came from. Be wary, the shadow is strongest where the light of the Sun and Moon cannot reach.
$Quest_GoldenThread_Event_october2021_09_Name=Slay Q'berus.
$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_09_Description=Shadow's Eve 9/11: The Gateway is crafted, it is now up to you to go to this Wolves' Den and eliminate the source.\n\nPlace the gateway and enter the Delve.

$Quest_GoldenThread_event_october2021_11_Description=Shadow's Eve 11/11: The source was a being called Q'berus? Interesting. When we return to our temples I shall delve into our libraries and research this being. That said, with the source defeated the curse will burn itself out, and the werewolves will fade with the hour of shadow.\n\nYou have proven yourself a valued ally of the Order of the Moon. Please take this and use it to craft our banner. Raise it high and help us guide the Moon Goddess back to Trove.

Unfortunately the other Qubesly are just as finicky with their diet as our speical guests are, PLUS they have to make sure all our chores are done.\n\nDo me a favor? I sent you some of the recipes for my favorite dishes, could you cook a few up? Same deal as before, and each one you cook will bring another me (with more chores) to the hub!
